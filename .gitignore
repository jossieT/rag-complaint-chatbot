# Ignore all data by default to avoid committing large files

# But we might want to keep the raw sample if it is small and needed for tests, 
# uncomment the following lines if you want to track the sample:
# !data/raw/complaints_sample.csv
# !data/processed/.gitkeep

# Specfic large files (redundant if data/ is ignored, but good for safety)
